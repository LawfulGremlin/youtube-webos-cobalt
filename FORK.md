# Fork notes

This repository is a shadow fork of
[RF1705/youtube-webos-cobalt-adfree](https://github.com/RF1705/youtube-webos-cobalt-adfree):
it is not registered as a GitHub fork, but `main` carries upstream's full history and is kept
up to date automatically.

## Rules

- **Pull only.** We fetch and merge from upstream on a schedule. We never push to upstream and
  never open issues, pull requests, or discussions there.
- **Work as patches.** Fork changes live in fork-owned files (listed in `.gitattributes` with
  `merge=ours`) or as additive patches, so upstream syncs merge cleanly. Avoid editing
  upstream-owned files.

## Automation

- `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml` — merges upstream `main` on the 1st and 15th of each
  month (or manually via *Run workflow*). Clean merges land on `main` directly; conflicts open
  a pull request in **this** repository for manual resolution.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — manual (*Run workflow*, takes a version). Builds the IPK
  from the current source, publishes a GitHub release `v<version>` with the IPK + webosbrew
  manifest, and regenerates `repo.json` on `main`.
